## Getting Started
Instructions to set up the environment and run the analysis.


- Analyzed modern Malayalam cinema trends using filtered IMDb data cross-referenced with Wikipedia movie lists (1990–2025).
- Visualized growth in movie production, evolution of top genres, and trends in IMDb ratings and user engagement (votes).
- Used only movies with realistic vote counts for "top-rated" analysis, to avoid small sample rating bias.
- Data may contain minor noise due to global title matches; future work includes integrating director/cast metadata.
